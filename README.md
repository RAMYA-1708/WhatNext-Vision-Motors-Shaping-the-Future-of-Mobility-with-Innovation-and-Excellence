### Dealer Assignment Automation
Using Salesforce Flows, customers are automatically assigned to the nearest authorized dealer based on their city or location.

### Stock Validation via Apex
Apex triggers and handlers validate vehicle stock availability before accepting orders, preventing overbooking and cancellations.

### Batch & Scheduled Apex
A nightly batch job updates pending orders based on updated stock, ensuring timely fulfillment without manual intervention.
